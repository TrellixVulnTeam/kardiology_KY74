21,The Holy Spirit can be Sinned Against,"The Holy Spirit is God and He can be sinned against. Scripture records these sins against the Holy Spirit: Grieving Him (Ephesians 4:30), quenching Him (I Thessalonians 5:19), blaspheming Him (Mark 3:29), insulting Him (Hebrews 10:29), lying to Him (Acts 5:3-4), and resisting Him (Acts 7:51). Believers are specifically commanded not to grieve or quench the Holy Spirit. To grieve the Holy Spirit is to cause Him sorrow and sadness because of indwelling sin. Quenching the Holy Spirit is allowing sin to hinder and stifle His influence, thus inhibiting His power to yield righteous fruit. ",Ephesians 4:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:19,The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
22,Believers are to walk in the Holy Spirit,"We are to walk in the power of and strive after the things of the Spirit, bearing the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

23,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Love,"Love (Galatians 5:22-23) is a benevolence and goodwill toward others that is produced by the Holy Spirit.

24,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Joy,"Joy (Galatians 5:22-23) is a gladness of heart produced by the Holy Spirit. Joy permeates one’s disposition despite trial, heartache, or pain.

26,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Patience,"Patience or longsuffering (Galatians 5:22-23), is forbearance shown toward others.

Contrary to patience are anger, wrath, pride, selfishness, and bitterness. ",Ephesians 4:1-2; 1 Thessalonians 5:14,The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
27,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Kindness,"Kindness (Galatians 5:22-23) is a pervasive spirit of gentleness and servanthood that is shaped and molded by the Holy Spirit’s indwelling power. It is motivated by sincere love for others. Kindness is similar to goodness, but goodness is the act of good works whereas kindness is the heart attitude behind the good works. Contrary to kindness are anger, bitterness, selfishness, and pride. ","2 Corinthians 6:4a, 6; Colossians 3:12",The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
28,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Goodness,"Goodness (Galatians 5:22-23) is an active expression of benevolence toward others as produced by the Holy Spirit. It is a love that motivates someone to serve others and help human need. Goodness is similar to kindness, but kindness is the heart attitude behind the good works whereas goodness is the act of good works. Goodness does manifest itself in gentle correction of others, for their benefit. Contrary to demonstrating goodness is to do evil or harm.",Romans 15:14; Ephesians 15:14,The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
29,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Faithfulness,"The word for “faithfulness” in Galatians 5:22 means to “win over” or “to persuade.” Faith, or faithfulness, as produced by the Holy Spirit, is a firm persuasion and conviction. It is a belief and confidence in the person of God and His revealed Word such that it brings forth holiness, obedience, and good works in a person’s life.

30,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Meekness,"Meekness (Galatians 5:22-23), also translated “gentleness,” is primarily a response to God. It is a state of heart that not only acknowledges God’s sovereign rule, but embraces His sovereign rule as good. A person with meekness does not blame God for undesirable circumstances, nor does he become angry with God when he does not get his way. Meekness must come from the power of the Holy Spirit. Contrary to meekness are despair, anger, wrath, impatience, anxiety, fear, and envy. ",Matthew 5:5; James 1:21,The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
31,The Holy Spirit Produces Fruit: Self-Control,"Self-control (Galatians 5:22-23), which is often translated “sober”, is a sober-mindedness that gives thought before acting. Self-control, which is produced by the Holy Spirit, gives way to godly desires rather than sinful desires. A person with self-control looks to future and eternal realities rather than indulging immediate sinful impulses. ","1 Thessalonians 5:6, 8; 1 Peter 1:13",The Ministry of the Holy Spirit
